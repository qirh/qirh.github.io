title: Living in a Closet
---

I'd like to preface this by saying that in this context, closet is a metaphor for a small space, and nothing more hehe

I don't actually live in a closet, but it is quite a small space, defintly one of the smallest that I've ever lived in. Well I've lived in a net smaller area per person (larger room but more people living in it). Which I feel gives more space to everyone since we shared the room essential things (candle, stationaries, ...) and thus we all ended up with more personal space.

However, I really like living in small space because it's forcing me not to buy too many things, because there's no place to put anything. Also, Living in small space is making me a much more organized person!
