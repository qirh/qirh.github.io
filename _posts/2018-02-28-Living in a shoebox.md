title: Living in a shoebox
---

My room in NYC is quite small, definitely one of the smallest space that I've ever lived in. Well, I've lived in a net smaller area per person (larger room but more people living in it). Which I feel gives more space to everyone since we shared the room essential things (candle, stationeries, ...) and thus we all ended up with more personal space.

But living in a small place has been a fun experience, there are ups and downs.

**Ups:**
1. I don't buy things anymore, simply because I have nowhere to put them. In a way, I haven't really owned that many things for a while, but now I own the least belongings out of all times in my life.
2. It's easy to keep tidy, since there aren't that many things to fold.

**Downs:**
1. It's hard to keep tidy, since things have to go on top of one another.
2. I'm big and tall and not that flexible, not very good traits to have when living in a small space.
3. In an oxymoron, being a minimalist is expensive (both time and money). At least for me.
4. It's hard to [pray](https://i2.wp.com/saioi.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Young-Muslim-praying-after-the-adults.jpg?resize=820%2C400&ssl=1) since there's no space.
5. This doesn't have much to do with the small space, but my view is meh, at least I have a window hehe

All in all, I like it, it's cozy and I haven't had to improvize and DIY this much in my living space before.
