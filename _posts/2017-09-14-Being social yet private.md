title: Being social yet private
---

I think that balancing these two aspects of my personality is the hardest challenge that I face daily. As one, by its nature, contradicts the other. I asked a good friend of mine where they would put me on the social scale and they said 9 out of 10. And I know for sure by virtue of being social, that I share much less aspects of my private life than the majority of the people I interact with.

And this isn't to say that the problem is in the friends that one has and whether they can be trusted or not, some people would just rather keep huge part of their lives to them selves.

Making these two personality traits hard to combine because, in order to build meaningful relationships with people, there first needs to be trust. And if one side of the relationship is not willing to share as much as the other, it is hard to establish trust, because the sharing side might feel a sense of imbalance, caused by them sharing more of their lives than the other side is willing to share. Unbeknownst to them that the not-sharing side, while very social, is still private, and to make things worse, they are very private about being the fact that they are private haha
