title: Why I don't have social media (LinkedIn in particular)
---

Social media is one of the worst things to happen to the internet.

The internet allows people from all different backgrounds to connect and share ideas and contribute to one another, in a way that no other medium has allowed before. However, the internet by itself can't connect people, there needs to be services built on top of it that do that, and that's why I was excited about the idea of social media when it began. Moreover, the social media boom in the middle east coincided with the Arab Spring, where citizens would report on things that the media either didn't know about or would never air.

I realized the power of social media during that time, and what attracted me most to them was the fact that unlike all other news organizations in the middle east, social media wasn't serving an ideology and an agenda, simply because the people reporting on it were representing all the sides.

So I got into social media, and it was exciting. I have had so many experiences and chance encounters that would not have been possible without social media. These platforms do so much good in the world, just the fact that they remind you of friends' birthdays is amazing and the events feature is really awesome, just to name a few features that solve real-life problems.

However, the main problem I have with social media, is that we, the consumers, are the product being sold. Now I understand that these are (mainly) free services and they need to generate revenue somehow, however, I think that pretty much each and every one of these services, time and time again has chosen to be greedy over looking after the interest of their consumer base.

Moreover, I think that social media is bad in the way that it tries to curate users' feeds so that they read what they like and what they identify with, which in turn would increase the user return rate. The problem with this kind of thought isolation is that it gives users the illusion of being on an open internet, of sharing thoughts an ideas with regular people, but the truth is that it is only showing users what they want to hear.

"If you like this, you will like that", is how social media operates, and again, the problem is that not only does social media make people ignorant by only showing them the opinions they agree with, but it does that while giving the illusion of being subjected to diverse views.

Personally, I think that I have a diverse network of friends and it's crazy to me how each group of them live in their own bubble, thinking that everyone perceives the world the way they do. Which isn't a problem by itself, not at all, but the fact is that most of these people have no idea how isolated in their way of thinking. Which connects to a bigger problem that exists in the world, **lack of empathy**.

Social media makes us not aware of what's actually going on around us, while giving the illusion of connecting the whole world together, most social media users have no idea what people in their neighborhood think. And that leads to a society that is never exposed to opposing views and cannot accept anyone that doesn't align with their way of thinking. Of course, it's a complex issue and social media isn't the sole culprit, but I do believe that they have taken one of the worst things about human beings (we like to live in bubbles) and exploited it for no other reason than to generate revenue.

This is only one of the negative effects of social media, besides the blatant disregard for their users' privacy, and having a goal of getting it's users addicted.

I don't have any problems with sharing information publicly, but I don't feel comfortable doing it on a corporation's platform that is looking to make it's money out of doing un-ethical things with my personal information.

Now to LinkedIn, in in my opinion it is the worst of the worst out of all social media platforms. And I won't get into the argument that it's just Facebook with ties, although it is. It's the worst social media because while it is just as toxic as the other ones, not having a LinkedIn will disadvantage you in the professional world.
