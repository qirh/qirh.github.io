title: Cameras and Face Detection
---

The dual nature of tech is that it solves so many problems, making lives easier, but it also introduces new problems that new generations are going to struggle trying to solve. A problem that I think is going to arise in the future is the lack or privacy due to how good face detection software is getting.

Regardless if you partake in taking pics/videos and publish them to the public, you simply can't be an active part of society without being subjected to being behind the lens of a camera. Even more, 

There are so many cameras taking footage nowadays, that you can't go anywhere in public without being behind the lens of a camera.

The combination of  getting better and cameras being everywhere is really scary to me.

I can totally see a future where you can type someone's name in a search engine and it would find them in all the videos that were taken today.
