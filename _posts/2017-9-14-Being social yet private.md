title: Being social yet private
---

I think that balancing these two aspects of my personality is the hardest challenge that I face daily. As one, by its nature, contradicts the other. I asked a good friend of mine where he would put me on the social scale and he said 9 out of 10. And I know for sure by virtue of being social, that I share much less aspects of my private life than the majority of people that I know.

Making these two personality traits hard to combine because, in order to build meaningful relationships with people, there first needs to be trust. And if one side of the relationship is not willing to share as much as the other, it is hard to establish trust, because the sharing side might feel a sense of unbalance, caused by them sharing more of their lives than the other side is willing to share. Unbeknownst to them that the not-sharing side, while very social, is still private, and is very private about being private haha
