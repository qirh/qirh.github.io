List of things I wish to accomplish while in New York:

* Learn a bit of Polish
* Frown more/smile less
* Learn how to sleep with all the noise
* Pick up at least a little bit of the new york accent (failed to accomplish this in TX unfortunately)
* Resist the urge to replace y'all with you guys
* Try to be rude to tourists
* Learn the city well so I can answer when people ask for directions
* Catch the train while the door is closing
* Be a really really fast walker
* Don't get robbed

Basically, I want people to be like "new york changed you"
