**NYC bucketlist:**

* Take a language class from a part of the world I know nothing about (maybe mandrin, hindi or haitin)
* Don't get fat
* ~~Get a standing desk~~
* Learn how to sleep through the noise
* Pick up at least a little bit of the new york accent (failed to accomplish this in TX unfortunately)
* DON'T replace y'all with you guys
* Learn to navigate the city so well that I can answer tourists when they ask for directions
* ~~Catch the train while the door is closing~~
* ~~Be a really really fast walker~~
* Don't get robbed

Basically, I want my friends and family to be like "new york changed you"
