List of things I wish to accomplish while in New York:

1. Learn a bit of Polish
2. Frown more/smile less
3. Learn how to sleep with all the noise
4. Pick up at least a little bit of the new york accent (failed to accomplish this in TX unfortunately)
5. Resist the urge to replace y'all with you guys
6. Try to be rude to tourists
7. Learn the city well so I can answer when people ask for directions
8. Catch the train while the door is closing
9. Be a really really fast walker
10. Don't get robbed

Basically, I want people to be like "new york changed you"
