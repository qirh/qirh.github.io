List of things I wish to accomplish while in New York:

1 - Learn a bit of Polish
2 - Frown more/smile less
3 - Learn how to sleep with all the noise
4 - Pick up at least a little bit of the new york accent (failed to accomplish this in TX unfortunately)
5 - Resist the urge to replace y'all with you guys
6 - Try to be rude to tourists
7 - Learn the city well so I can answer when people ask for directions

Basically, I want people to be like "new york changed you"
