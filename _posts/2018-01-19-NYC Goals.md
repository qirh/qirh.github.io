**NYC bucketlist:**

| Jan 2018 (original) | Apr 2018 (update) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Take a language class from a part of the world I know nothing about (maybe mandrin, hindi or haitin) | Never had time :( |
| Resist the urge to eat everything all the time | I've gotten fat |
| ~~Get a standing desk at work~~ | It's cardboard, but it works :) |
| Learn how to sleep through the noise | Sleeping is overrated anyways |
| Pick up at least a little bit of the new york accent (failed to accomplish this in TX unfortunately) | It's harder than I expected :( |
| DON'T replace y'all with you guys | There's a lot of peer pressure, but I'm holding strong |
| Learn to navigate the city so well that I can answer tourists when they ask for directions | I have become NYC |
| ~~Catch the train while the door is closing~~ | Too many times |
| ~~Be a really really fast walker~~ | üèÉ‚Äç |
| Don't get robbed | Nothing so far :) But honestly, NYC is safe! |
| ~~I want my friends and family to be like "new york changed you"~~ | Haha yup |
