title: The Americas
---

I think that, in general, people of the Americas have always been the most accepting/welcoming in my experience. Of course it's hard to generalize these things. But I think that while cultures in the Americas vary greatly from one another, they all seem to share their openness to outsiders, which is amazing. Saying that, I do realize that I am very bias, since the Americas are my favorite place on earth. I only wish that one day I can travel from Fairbanks to Ushuaia without worrying about borders and visas :)
