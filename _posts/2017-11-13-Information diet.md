I have a very delicate relationship with information. I love to be informed about what is going on in the world in general and more specifically certain locations that I have a personal connection to.

While digesting a huge amount of information about the world helps keep me informed about the world, it is also a distraction from my current surroundings. That is because while I try to be more connected and keep up with things all over, it is hard to notice small things in my daily life that might have a bigger impact on my current situation.

Thus, I'm currently trying to find a happy middle, where I can still casually walk around without having headphones on, yet still try to keep up with current world affairs.
