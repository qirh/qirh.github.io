title: The future and automation
---

As more jobs are lost to either better alternatives for the environment or for the sake of automation. The question must be asked of what will happen to the people that were working these jobs. Even if other opportunities are created for them, halting someone's career and forcing them to change will most obviously lower their income, thus having a negative impact on their livelihood and everyones' who depends on them.

Moreover, as an example of automation, driverless cars, which when fully implemented, will be much safer and more efficient than human drivers. But it will also cause millions of people to lose their jobs. Similarly piloting aircrafts and ordering food, all seem to be careers that will be human independent in the coming few years. An example of the affect of robots on job market would be astronauts, a career that is unfortunately almost non-existent by this point.

What will happen when robots have such good movement that they can work all labor jobs with better accuracy than humans (and of course, eventually for much cheaper and much more environmentally friendly). Then they would of course be able to be better accountants, doctors and even maybe researchers than humans. I think the first people that would suffer from this automation wave would be labor jobs and then not long after, almost everyone else would be replaced by a more efficient machine.

Therefore, I think there will only be two ways to counter this catastrophe-to-be in which people, everyone, would be jobless. One, the obvious solution, is that we simply stop pursuing the development of robots. Now, I don't think that's a solution that should be persuaded. Secondly, and I don't know how this will sound, but, if robots are going to do everything for us, and even more, if they will be self sufficient, then why don't we just relax and distribute the fruit of the robots' labor equally among ourselves. I think that socialism is almost impossible to implement in any current society today. But, in the future, when we're all so useless and have nothing to do, it would be a perfect opportunity to give it a shot!
