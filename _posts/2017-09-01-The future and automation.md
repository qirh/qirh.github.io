title: The future and automation
---

I can't imagine a job that won't be lost due to automation.

As an example of automation, driverless cars, which when fully implemented, will be much safer and more efficient than human drivers. But it will also cause millions of people to lose their jobs. Similarly, customer support and ordering food, all seem to be careers that will be human independent in the near future.

When an example of a career that already went extinct due to robots would be astronauts, a career that is unfortunately almost non-existent by this point.

What will happen when robots have such good movement that they can work all labor jobs with better accuracy than humans (and of course, eventually for much cheaper and much more environmentally friendly). Then they would, of course, be able to be better accountants, doctors and even maybe researchers than humans. 

Therefore, in order to avoid a future where 99% of the people are jobless and poor, I think we only have two options:

1. We simply stop pursuing the development of robots and technology and just be happy with what we have achieved as a race so far and just stop all development.

2. If robots are going to do everything for us, even better and cheaper than how humans used to do them, then why don't we just relax and let them do it. This would be a perfect opportunity to introduce a universal basic income that provides everyone with a decent life. Of course, there are issues around what the point of our existence would if we can't do anything productive, but I'm sure that when we get there, we'll find something to do.
