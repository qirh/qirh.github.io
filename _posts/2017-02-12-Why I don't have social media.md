title: Why I don't have social media
---

Social media is the worst thing that happened to the internet.

The internet allows people from all different backgrounds to connect and share ideas and contribute to one another, in a way that no other medium has allowed before. However, the internet by itself can't connect people, there needs to be services built on top of it to do that, and that's why I was excited about the idea of social media when I first heard about.

A simple example of how social media can bring people together in a way that was never done before is the Arab Spring, where people reported on things that the media either didn't know about or wasn't interested in covering.

I realized the power of social media during that time, and what attracted me most to them was the fact that unlike all other news organizations in the Middle East, social media wasn't serving an ideology and an agenda, simply because the people reporting on it were representing all the sides.

So I got into social media, and it was exciting. I have had so many experiences and chance encounters that would not have been possible without social media. These platforms do so much good in the world, just the fact that they remind you of friends' birthdays is amazing and the fact that they allow you to stay connected with people even after they change their phone numbers/move to another country/lose access to their email is really awesome. Social media platforms have solved a lot of these that I have struggled a lot with in my life.

However, with all that said, the negative effects of social media far outweigh the positives, here's why:


* Social media is bad because it tries to get it's users addicted by curating their feeds. This feeds into a much bigger problem, because the internet is supposed the place to be exposed to new ideas and views. Yet most social media platforms, there is such a [bubble effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) that a user would have to go out of their way to find see dissent views. The problem with this kind of thought isolation is that it gives users the illusion of being on an open internet, of interacting with human beings the same they interact with people in real life, when in truth they are only interacting with those whom the algorithm chooses to make visible.

    "If you like this, you will like that", is how social media operates, and again, the problem is that not only does social media make people ignorant by only showing them the opinions they agree with, but it does that while giving the illusion of being subjected to diverse views. Which connects to a bigger problem that exists in the world, **lack of empathy**.

* They're not free to use, we're just paying with our time and attention. I think that pretty much each and every one of these services, time and time again has chosen to be greedy over looking after the interest of their consumer base.

    I do want to share my data on the web, but same as in life, I want to share my data on my own terms, and that's why I don't like using social media. Because these platforms, simply [don't](http://time.com/collection/guide-to-happiness/4882372/social-media-facebook-instagram-unhappy/) [care](https://freedom.to/blog/3-reasons-social-media-making-you-unhappy/)

You see, the problem with social media platforms is that they are [designed to be addictive](http://adamalterauthor.com/irresistible/), to keep you in the hook, as a long as possible. Because the economy is shifting, yesteryear's way of selling an item to a person then ending the transaction isn't lucrative enough. They want you to get hooked, to "like" more, to "share" more, to come back again and again and again so that they control what you see, what you hear, how you perceive events around the world and ultimately how you think.


* Lastly, social media is bad because **there is no escape**, there is no opt-out. Don't want your information on Facebook/Twitter/Insta or whatever, well tough luck, because even if you don't use it, someone in your vicinity will upload your share your information on your behalf.

  Even if people you know don't upload any of your information, there are so many people steaming and taking videos and pictures that it's impossible not to be behind a lens. And with the advancement of facial recognition, I think in the nesar future we would have the ability to search all live streams looking for a face.


Almost all social media platforms are guilty of the above, but in my opinion, **LinkedIn is hte worst offender of them all**.

With all that, for me persoanlly, the thing that irrates me most about social media is that it is centralizing the internet. While I like the fact that users can log in to a single service and find a diverse array of content, this centralzation is makes the internet boring.
