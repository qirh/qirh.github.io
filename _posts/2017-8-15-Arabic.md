Ok, so tropes of writing when Arabic as one's native language are: (list will be updated once I find other than one hehe)

* Run on sentences!! I thought it was just Arabic speakers that did that, but no, Hebrew speakers as well, and according to a linguistician that I met a long time ago, native speakers of all semitic languages have this problem. But I don't know what was meant by semitic languages, does that include Maltese? I know very little of it, but from the little impression I have, they seem to write the way a native latin language speaker would write. also, I would love one day to learn Tigrinya and Amharic, even if it was just a little to compare how semitic languages relate to each other! Hopefully one day when I settle in post-university life.
