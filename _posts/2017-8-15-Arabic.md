Tropes of writing in English when Arabic is one's native language include: (list will be updated once I find other than one hehe)

* Run on sentences!! I thought it was just Arabic speakers that did that, but no, Hebrew speakers do as well, and according to a language guru that ago, native speakers of all semitic languages have this problem. But I don't know what he meant by semitic languages, does that only include Arabic, Hebrew and Maltese? Because from the little exposure that I have with it, Maltese speakers seem to write the way a native latin-root language speaker would write. Lastly, I don't know if Tigrinya and Amharic are considered semitic, but they both sound really beautiful and I wish one day to learn them :)
