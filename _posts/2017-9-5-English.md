Ok so it's really interesting why certain languages are perceived as "pretty" and others don't. I believe it's mostly all a construct, but I have no evidence for such belief. But I think if one were to poll people around the world on what are the most beautiful languages, there would naturally be many answers. However, probably at the top would be some romance languages like French and Italian. I don't think English would be in the top though.

However, for me, English is the most beautiful language in the world. Not because of how it sounds or its' characteristics, but because I think part of the beauty of a language are the people that speak it. And knowing English has enabled me to meet a lot of people that I wouldn't have been able to communicate with otherwise and that makes me really thankful to have learnt English and makes it a pretty language in my eyes.

p.s another thing that I appreciate about English is the lack of accents, it's so nice not to worry about accents :)
