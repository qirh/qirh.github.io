title: My story with tech
---

All my experiences with work before Kiva have been field jobs. And I really enjoy that kind of work. I like being on the front line, dealing with people and making things work. That kind of work was a great opportunity for me to work on me soft skills, and simply, it makes me feel more human by connecting with other people, I always had a constant stream of diverse friendships from work.

However, working in the field left me wanting more work responsibilities, I felt like I have important and useful skills that I was not utilizing. It's also small scale and takes a long time. Interacting with people directly makes me really happy in life. But at the same time, I always left feeling that I could have had more impact if I had more reach. Which is why I'm not pursuing it as a career.

I have always been a tech head and the more I learn more about computers and how they work, the more excited I get about working as a software engineer.

In my life, I've travelled and spent extensive time in Latin America, Europe and North Africa. Finally settling in Texas to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Bearing witness to such a diversity of lives, values, and ways of being has drastically shaped my understanding of the world. Moving across the globe to a country where I knew no one was very challenging in the beginning. However, thanks to how I was taught to treat people with love, care, and respect, it was not a long time until I had good people around me that I considered as a second family away from home.

Traveling not only has shown me how important it is to open up to people, but has exposed me to sides of life I had never seen before, including extreme poverty. Nothing has shaped my life experiences as much as seeing how unfair and unjust poverty is in many places in the world. In the same vein, I realize now that the way to try and bridge the gap between the most and least privileged in the world is not by individual acts of charity, but a more nuanced approach.

An important part of this process is by implementing systems that help the less privileged to overcome the hardships that most people in the world would never have to confront. In addition to these systemic changes, it seems necessary to bridge the gulfs of inequity through the development of technology. This particular aspect is what I wish to dedicate my life to because I believe that increasing access to information and ability is one of the most efficient, unbiased, and universal ways to make what was once unattainable within reach for everyone.

And that's my story with tech, that's why I studied and dedicated so much of my time to Computer Science. Because I believe that developing my skills and becoming a good software engineer is the best way for me to help the world be a better place.
