I had always dreamed that if all people could speak the same language, there would cease to be conflict. Whenever I meet Hebrew or Persian speakers, one of the first things that must come up, are the conflicts that exists between speakers of said language and arabs. I would always voice my (at the time) conviction that if these took the time to learn each others' languages, they would just understand each other, and have empathy for one another and peace would ensue after that.

Out of the 10s (100s?) of people that I said that to, almost all unanimously agreed. All except one, who brought up the point that people, belonging to the same culture/language get into conflicts all the time. Moreover, while in softer words, the polite man he is, said that while this concept of learning languages as a way of fixing the world is just pure childish.

I have to confess, that I am saddened by this revelation, because it is something that I wanted to be true out of the nobility of it, but I have to agree with the polite man, it might not be as true as I hoped it is. Finally, I do believe that sharing a language with someone will probably positively correlate to their empathetic relationship. However, as much as i wish it, most unfortunately, I don't believe there must exist a positive correlation between language acquisition and empathy.
