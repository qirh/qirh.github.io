In general, software is not as reliable as other things that we build, it requires constant maintenance just to keep functioning. And as wonderful as software it, I am willing to wager that most of the software that has been built is already broken. Because while the other things that we build do rely on other services i.e. cars rely on petrol to work at all.

However, software is unique though, because for this example, the petrol industry has existed for a long time and is run by money and profits, thus petrol is always ensured to flow. On the other hand a lot of software relies on services that are free or cost a cheap fee. Thus there is not an incentive to keep these services always up and running and more importantly, legacy compatible. For example, if a user/password authentication service decides that they need update their security and not allow legacy compatibility then every software that is not currently in maintenance will go down.

The last point is that I think most people, both software savvy and not, underestimate how hard and expensive it is to maintain code. It took humanity thousands of years of engineering to get to the level of architecture and building that we have right now. But coding however, we just have not had the time to develop coding standards and practices the same that other industries and for that reason, our code are not as rigid as our buildings.
