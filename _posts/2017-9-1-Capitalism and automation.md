title: Capitalism and automation
---

For the sake of the generation that will come after us, we should reduce, or even try to completely cut our usage of fossil fuels. That's a fact that I don't think two people would disagree on as burning fuels is not good for our lungs nor the environment.

However, the problem with established industries that science has come up with a better alternative for is that they employ a lot of people, whose livelihoods now depend on said industries. For example, the coal and oil industry, and I know that this sounds biased. But seriously, oil and coal are horrible things, and we as a civilization should try to move away from them. However, as destructive as these industries are to the environment, we should also take into consideration that many peoples' livelihoods and their families depend on them.

Never in our history as a species, have we changed how the distribution of wealth is handled. Ideally, people should start at the same place, with similar or identical opportunities, and then as they learn and work more, they also make more capital and can afford more and better things. Now, this model, ideally, while being very different from actuality, doesn't seem too bad.

However, as more jobs are lost to either better alternatives for the environment or automation. Which are both good causes, the question must be asked of what will happen to the people that were working those jobs. Even if other opportunities are created for them, halting someone's career and forcing them to change will most obviously lower their income, thus having a negative impact on them and their families.

Moreover, as an example of automation, driverless cars, which when fully implemented, will be much safer and more efficient than human drivers. Will also cause millions of people to lose their jobs. Similarly flying and ordering food, all seem to be careers that will be human independent in the coming few years. A more egregious example  would be astronauts, a career that is unfortunately almost extinct by this point.

What will happen when robots have such good movement that they can work all labor jobs with better accuracy than humans (and of course, eventually for much cheaper). Then they would of course be able to be better accountants, doctors and even maybe researchers than humans. I think the first people that would suffer from this automation wave would be blue labor and then not long after, almost everyone else would be replaced by a more efficient machine.

Therefore, I think there will only be two ways to counter this catastrophe-to-be in which people, everyone, would be jobless. One, the obvious solution, is that we simply stop pursuing the development of robots. Now, I don't think that's a solution that should be persuaded. Secondly, and I don't know how this will sound, but, if robots are going to do everything for us, and even more, if they will be self sufficient, then why don't we just relax and distribute the fruit of the robots' labor equally among ourselves. I think that socialism is almost impossible to implement in any current society today. But, in the future, when we're all so lazy and do nothing, it would be a perfect opportunity to give it a shot!
