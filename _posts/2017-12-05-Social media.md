There are so many things that I like about social media, it keeps me connected with so many people that I love and care about that I would never have the time to be connected with otherwise. However, it is also a double edged sword, I hate so many things about it, without much detail, these are some of things that bother me most about it.

  * For many people (almost everyone I know) it is an extremely toxic echo chamber. And while most people live their lives only being exposed to opinions that they agree with. In the case of social media, it is a little bit different, because social media sells itself as a platform that connects people from all backgrounds, but often, social media is curated to enforce tunnel visioning among it's users.

  * The illusion of checking up on friends, but not really. I like keeping up with friends and knowing where they are in life, even if we're too bust to talk. However, more often than not, I get the feeling that I am hearing way too much from about certain about and way too little from certain people. Thus making social media a not very effective way to check up on people.

  * Privacy: I dislike that social media tracks it's users. And also, I dislike that there exists a public history of me.

  * I feel like posting on social media is like gathering all my friends in one room and having their attention to say something. And honestly, when I think of having such a diverse group of people in one place, I just can't think of a common denominator between them all that I could use to start a conversation.
