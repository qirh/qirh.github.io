title: Empirical measuring system
---

I agree that the metric system makes more sense and is easier to use and it that it deserves to be the global standard. However, I also think that there is room for multiple measurement systems in our daily lives.

I don't think it's fair for people to ask for the elimination of the empirical system (or any other ones). In fact, I think that people can easily think in two measurement system. It's a skill, not unlike many other skills. Same as how people who drive their vehicles during, usually find no problems driving them at night, although it's a significantly different environment.

Moreover, I think that when a person learns to simultaneously utilize different measurement systems. They develop an intuition and a deeper knowledge on the measurements/sizes of things. Same as how learning a foreign language can have someone look into their native language/culture in a different perspective.

Finally, looking at the future, I think the areas of the worlds that still use the empirical system should still keep using it for daily life use but at the same time emphasize the usage of the metric system for any measurement that requires precision, science for example.
