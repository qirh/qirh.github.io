title: The price of going green
---

For the sake of the generations that will come after us, we should reduce, or even try to completely cut our usage of fossil fuels. That's a fact that I don't think two people would disagree on as burning fuels is not good for our lungs nor the environment.

However, as more jobs are lost to either better alternatives for the environment or for the sake of automation, the question must be asked of what will happen to the people that were working these jobs. Even if other opportunities are created for them, halting someone's career and forcing them to change will most obviously lower their income, thus having a negative impact on their livelihood and everyone's who depends on them.

The problem with established industries that science has overlapped and made obsolete is that they employ a lot of people. People whose livelihoods now depend on said industries. For example, the coal and oil industry, and I know that this sounds biased. But seriously, oil and coal are horrible things, and we should try to move away from them towards more sustainable energy sources. However, as destructive as these industries are to the environment, when considering moving away from them, we should also take into account that many peoples' livelihoods and their families depend on these archaic industries.

update: I found this amazing paper by the  [Just Transition Centre](https://www.oecd.org/environment/cc/g20-climate/collapsecontents/Just-Transition-Centre-report-just-transition.pdf)
