Ok, so the secret is yogurt and sumac in the blender and a twist of lime.

### More Information
Hey, I'm saleh, and I am a bit of a perfectionist and that has led me to cancel a lot of personal projects, because I could never find enough time to work on them and get them to a level that I like. However, I'm starting this project with the goal of trying to fight the urge of cancelling it even if it is flawed and so many the posts are unedited.
