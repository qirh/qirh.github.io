btw, hey, I'm Saleh, I'm starting this blog with the goal of trying to fight the the perfectionist urge that I have that usually leads me to delete projects. This is blog #4 or #5, I forget. But, as long as you're seeing this, I'm winning over my inner self :)

My email is [saleh@alghusson.com](mailto:saleh@alghusson.com), feel free to reach out ðŸ˜‡
