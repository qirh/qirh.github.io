Ok, so the secret is yogurt and sumac in the blender and a twist of lime.

### More Information
Hey, I'm saleh, and I have made so many blogs only for them to be deleted. Hopefully, perhaps this one will survive a little bit longer. My email is listed in the bottom banner, please let me know what you think! Also, this blog is powered by [Jekyll Now.](http://http://www.jekyllnow.com/)

p.s most of the work that I do in my life I either want it to be good, or I do it for someone and thus want to turn in something that is good. However, this blog is neither of those two, so I'm probably not going to proof read anything
